# What are React Hooks

React Hooks (version 16.8 release) allow you to use state and other lifecycle methods within a function-based component(functional stateless components).

It let's you use state and other React features without writing a class.

A Hook is a special function that let's you "hook into" React features. For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

For example, if you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
